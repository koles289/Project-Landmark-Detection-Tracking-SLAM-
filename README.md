#  UDACITY <br> Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

Goal of this project is to implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! <br> 
It works with robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. This method takes into account the motion and the measurement noise, so it usable in real word application. <br>  SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.<br>

Below is an example of a 2D robot world with landmarks located and found using only sensor and motion data collected by that robot. <br>
